# Hi, I'm Nico a.k.a Caiman

I'm a **Front-End Developer** with a passion for clean, responsive interfaces and intuitive user experiences.

I work confidently with:
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**
- **React**
- **Figma**

My goal is to bring designs to life with **precision**, **structure**, and a strong sense of **usability**.

##  Outside the code...

I'm also a **Techno producer and DJ**.  
I bring the same attention to **rhythm, balance, and flow** from my musical work into the way I approach development.

##  What I'm doing now

-  Sharpening my skills with **React** and **JavaScript** projects  
-  Looking for opportunities to grow as a **junior developer**  
-  Building up my portfolio with practical, clean, and responsive designs  
-  Releasing techno mixes every week...
